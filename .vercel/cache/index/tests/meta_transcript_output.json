We started kind of moving more towards the enterprise over the last four or five months and have gotten a lot of steam there. And so, you know, the majority of the customers that we are onboarding now or looking to close over the next quarter will be taking advantage of our API or some sort of integration rather than using like a web based version of our platform. They might be just kind of interface with the web based version of the app during like an onboarding period. But outside of that, you know, we're trying to basically stream everything into their existing systems or CRMs. And so sometimes that looks like Salesforce. There is a bank where bank wealth management firm that we're in procurement now that has like, Built out their own custom solution. So it'd like actually be an API based integration.

And obviously if you've never sold an API product, it's, it's challenging because there's, there's not much to see. Right. Just a bunch of data.

So that's why I was asking if you guys had public docs, because you can plug in like open API specs, postman collections, or just drop in a couple endpoints and then create different templates. So for you guys, I'd imagine like a CRM template. This is like that nihilist one where they wanted to show what it would look like to embed and integrate email threads within a CRM.

But once the template is built, what's really cool, and this is where we get a lot of usage is let's say, you know, Jacob, obviously you're leading probably growing up the sales team. You're about to hop on a call and you know, someone wants to use your APIs in a more integrated way. You'd come in a coast, you'd say, hey, I want to create a new demo. It's based on this use case. These are just fake ones, but maybe it's the CRM template and you say, hey, we want to sell to, you know, Morgan Stanley or whoever it is, you just type in their name and then what coast will do is actually personalize this demo experience for them. Right. So the UI we showcase will be like a mocked up Morgan Stanley or you can see like, I've done a bunch of banks. And then you can also customize it further. So what's cool too is that these demos can actually be hooked up live to your environments. So what's like, oftentimes a really fun experience is through the demo, you can put in someone's name and actually make a real call. And you can kind of impress them with like how accurate or, you know, fast your APIs are. If you don't want to hook up to like a sandbox. If you don't have like a good production environment that's stable, you can also mock it too. So you don't have to worry about like, you know, it not working real time. We have different options to do that. But other things you can customize, you can, you can add in a bunch of these customization items. You know, like for a lot of our fintechs, they're pitching to people all over the world, so they might want to change the currency depending on the demo. For you guys, I'm sure there's different things you can think about as well. And then you get this demo link. And so, right, the idea is you've created these templates that you can instantly rebrand for anyone you're pitching to. And then you can open up this demo link, present it live, send it out as a follow up, and it's going to visualize how your APIs would create some sort of experience for your prospect. Right. So this is a very different use case. That's why we do the psc. So stay with me. But basically, here's a request where someone's putting in their information, like, Jacob, you want to sign up right on the right. We can actually see this interact, live with the API and then execute something and get data back. Right? So now we're showing, hey, look, when I put in Jacob's name, we're going to create their account, we're going to do KYC on Jacob, we're going to sign them up, and we get some sort of response data and you can kind of chain together a ton of different API calls. So now, like, we fetched their checkings and their savings account, we got transactions. And so for you guys, it would probably be more of like this type of dashboard experience. But I'm imagining like you put in a name, a request fires behind the scenes. It says, look at all this cool data we're pulling. And then you can visualize charts and, you know, stats and all the kind of cool things you guys pull to be able to say, hey, look, we provide all this data. Here's how you could tie it into your systems with a couple API calls. So there's a lot more. Maybe I'll pause there and see if this is kind of tracking for you guys.",

But no one has asked us for like, what would this look like inside? Or how would this data be presented? It's mostly been, oh, we can hook up to your internal or, oh, we can hook up with Salesforce. That makes sense. Rather than them needing the extra visualization in order to capture what's going on. But I know that sounds kind of negative, but overall, I mean, like, the UI is super clean. It's very. I like the fact that you can update it in real time. So I don't want to sound too negative. I just don't. As of right now, I don't know how much use we would get out of it, but I can certainly see it being impactful if the time did come when a lot of these enterprises are like, okay, like how would this even happen on a more technical API lens?",
